# Techdegree Project 6
 A project designed to house and highlight all of my projects.
 
 It uses node.js, express, and pug templates to make a website to highlight all my work up to this point.  It uses a .json  file to store the data for each project.

 Easily scalable to accept future projects.

 CSS styling:
    Added animations to the index page and some shadows to the square images.
    Font-families were adjusted for personal preference.
