            p.text-light When I graduated from James Madison University in 2012 with a B.S. in Geographic Sciences, I felt lost. About a year later after many failed job applications I found myself in Charlottesville. I became one of the founding members of The Juice Laundry and have been selling organic juice for the past 5 years.  We sold organic juice through the farmers market and eventually opened our first physical location in the fall of 2015. I became the general manager and helped us expand from 1 store to 3. I learned a lot about how to manage conflicts with employees, customers, and how to solve the unique problems that surfaced each and every day. 
            p.text-light Once the bigger picture problems were solved, I realized I had fallen into a slump and hardly needed to use my brain at work.  I talked with some of my closest friends and the discussions led to coding. My friend took a coding boot camp and I tried it out a month later. It was a tough month, I would work 9-10 hours at the juice job and then 3 hours M-Th in the evenings.  It was an exhausting experience, but I knew I had to go after it. After putting in my two-weeks in June I have been pursuing the Javascript Fullstack Techdegree through Treehouse as if I were working a fulltime job. It is my dream to create websites and products that allow people to live a more sustainable life. It is my goal to start a new career and new journey in January of 2020 after completing this course.
